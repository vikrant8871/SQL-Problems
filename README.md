SQL is a powerful programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. SQL queries allow you to extract data from tables, join tables, filter data based on conditions, and aggregate data into meaningful summaries. Here are the top 45 SQL queries that will help you master the language and become a skilled SQL developer.

SELECT: The SELECT statement is the most basic SQL query that retrieves data from one or more tables.

FROM: The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which to retrieve data.

WHERE: The WHERE clause filters the data based on specified conditions.

ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause sorts the data in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.

GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause groups the data based on one or more columns and allows you to perform aggregate functions on each group.

HAVING: The HAVING clause filters the data based on aggregate function results.

DISTINCT: The DISTINCT keyword removes duplicate rows from the result set.

JOIN: The JOIN keyword combines data from two or more tables based on a common column.
